# MyDevelopmentalBlog

## Week 1:

After the first lesson of ID module, I've gained a brief perspective about web development and how several languages is used or applied in the web. Moreover, I've learned the types of web developer like frontend developers which basically code the part of the websites that the user sees or interacts with and brings the web designer' designs to life using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. While for backend developers, they build or maintain the technology needed to power the frontend. Apart from these, I get to make my own recipe card using HTML and CSS for the weekly CAs.

## week 2:

This week lesson is about 'Semantic-CSS' where I have a deeper learning about how semantics work on web development. I discovered how semantics like div, header, footer, section and many more are use to seperate content in HTML. Not to mention, I get to know how to apply different colors and fonts on text. And most importantly, classes and attributes are also taught where it is used to group elements for styling.

## week 3:

This week in fact was a bit challenging than the previous week where I learned about Media queries which is used to modify the CSS of a site depending on viewport size and device type. Apart from this was Flexbox, where it is easier to align items vertically and horizontally using rows and columns. Last but not least was Adobe XD, a platform for building wireframe prototypes where I can have a clearer idea and image on how my project layout should be like.

## week 4:

For this week there isn't too much stuff to digest. However, I find responsive images interesting where I can have a better design control at the same time better performance when loading higher resolution images. After some learning and practices about how responsive images works, we were assigned for our first assignment for the module about designing and developing a website where I get to choose from fictional or real company site of my own to develop.

## week 5:

As this week is whitespace week, I used the time to look through all the past tutorial slides and the CAs I have done to have a quick revision and recap to work on my assignment where I have decided to design a fictional company of my own. Futhermore, I also spend some time watching through the videos published on linkedin learning about JavaScript and was able to complete the week's CAs.

## week 6:

For week 6, I did learned some basic knowledges about JavaScript which consists of objects and Dom. Additionally, the lesson do also include a recap about linkedin learning for week 5. I enjoyed learning about JavaScript as it is important when it comes to page interaction when building a web.

## week 7:

For week 7, I've went through Document Object Model(DOM) which is about the model of the webpage and defines the structure of the documents and the way they are accessed. It took me some time to digest about DOM as there are multiple ways to access elements. Moreover, was about Event Handling which is about event objects where it tells information about the event, and the element it happened. Last but not least, information validation to avoid user from entering invalid inputs where it consist of server-side validation and client-side validation. And this week is the submission deadline for the assignment so I managed to wrap everything up and submit.
