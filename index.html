      <h2>Week 1:</h2>
      <h3>
        After the first lesson of ID module, I've gained a brief perspective
        about web development and how several languages is used or applied in
        the web. Moreover, I've learned the types of web developer like frontend
        developers which basically code the part of the websites that the user
        sees or interacts with and brings the web designer' designs to life
        using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. While for backend developers, they
        build or maintain the technology needed to power the frontend. Apart
        from these, I get to make my own recipe card using HTML and CSS for the
        weekly CAs.

      <h2>Week 2:</h2>
      <h3>
        This week lesson is about 'Semantic-CSS' where I have a deeper learning
        about how semantics work on web development. I discovered how semantics
        like div, header, footer, section and many more are use to seperate
        content in HTML. Not to mention, I get to know how to apply different
        colors and fonts on text. And most importantly, classes and attributes
        are also taught where it is used to group elements for styling.

      <h2>Week 3:</h2>
      <h3>
        This week in fact was a bit challenging than the previous week where I
        learned about Media queries which is used to modify the CSS of a site
        depending on viewport size and device type. Apart from this was Flexbox,
        where it is easier to align items vertically and horizontally using rows
        and columns. Last but not least was Adobe XD, a platform for building
        wireframe prototypes where I can have a clearer idea and image on how my
        project layout should be like.

      <h2>Week 4:</h2>
      <h3>
        For this week there isn't too much stuff to digest. However, I find
        responsive images interesting where I can have a better design control
        at the same time better performance when loading higher resolution
        images. After some learning and practices about how responsive images
        works, we were assigned for our first assignment for the module about
        designing and developing a website where I get to choose from fictional
        or real company site of my own to develop.

      <h2>Week 5:</h2>
      <h3>
        As this week is whitespace week, I used the time to look through all the
        past tutorial slides and the CAs I have done to have a quick revision
        and recap to work on my assignment where I have decided to design a
        fictional company of my own. Futhermore, I also spend some time watching
        through the videos published on linkedin learning about JavaScript and
        was able to complete the week's CAs.

      <h2>Week 6:</h2>
      <h3>
        For week 6, I did learned some basic knowledges about JavaScript which
        consists of objects and Dom. Additionally, the lesson do also include a
        recap about linkedin learning for week 5. I enjoyed learning about
        JavaScript as it is important when it comes to page interaction when
        building a web.

      <h2>Week 7:</h2>
      <h3>
        For week 7, I've went through Document Object Model(DOM) which is about
        the model of the webpage and defines the structure of the documents and
        the way they are accessed. It took me some time to digest about DOM as
        there are multiple ways to access elements. Moreover, was about Event
        Handling which is about event objects where it tells information about
        the event, and the element it happened. Last but not least, information
        validation to avoid user from entering invalid inputs where it consist
        of server-side validation and client-side validation. And this week is
        the submission deadline for the assignment so I managed to wrap
        everything up and submit.

      <h2>Week 8:</h2>
      <h3>
        This week is about jQuery which is a JavaScript library that enables
        faster and easier way for writing JavaScript. By using jQuery it allows
        me to select or find elements and update the content and size and
        enables simplification of event handling. Besides, I got to learn about
        Ajax which is a technique for loading data into art of page without the
        need to refresh the entire webpage. Moreover, was about accessing API
        which include a 'fetch' function where i find it interesting as it
        allows to fetch resources across the network.

      <h2>Week 9:</h2>
      <h3>
        This week is mainly about Bootstrap, a faster way to create User
        interfaces and to resolve all the nooks and crannies imposed by all the
        various browsers and devices. I find it very interesting as it allows me
        to reduce variance in the model and the benefits of using it and how it
        can be implemented in my machine learning projects.

      <h2>Week 12:</h2>
      <h3>
        Week 12 is about dealing with data with SQL & RestDB and some recap on
        jQuery and Local Storage. Not to mention, i found RestDB quite
        challenging as you have to link multiple datas in order to retrieve or
        manipulate data and testing it at the same time dealing with javaScript
        using jQuery Ajax. To sum up, this week I've explored the basics
        knowledges about API learning, handling errors, and making request.

      <h2>Week 13:</h2>
      <h3>
        Nothing much for week 13, in fact I've got to learn how to avoid common
        mistakes and the best practices. Moreover, i discovered some interesting
        ways to format your ReadME file and how to avoid poor commit. One common
        mistake i often make is 'Messy file structure' i tend to not file my
        projects orderly and in same category and sometimes even in bad naming.
        But thankfully afterwards, i do name my file meaningfully and properly
        and file them base on the same categories.

      <h2>Week 14:</h2>
      <h3>
        Week 14 is very much interesting, which is about Lottie animations.
        Where it can play animation on web and mobile devices while still
        maintaining a nice and high quality. And with LottieFiles it allows me
        to import and preview the Lottie animation and it will generate the
        lines of code that you can use to implement your animations in your
        projects.
